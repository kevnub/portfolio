                    <p class="article" >
                        Enova is a biomimicry engineering group on campus at the University of Calgary that contacted
                        me to redesign their website. They had already designed and implemented code their club website
                        but wanted something that looked more professional.</br>This project took less than a week to complete
                        since I was able to frequently meet up with the client to make sure I was providing everything they wanted. <br><br>
                        Since I was the one to implement the code for the website, I designed something that was within my coding
                        capabilities. I wanted to take advantage of the MaterializeCSS framework that I used to create this website
                        and, as a result, I was able to quickly come up with high-fidelity prototypes for the client.
                    </p>
                    <h1 > The Home Page </h1>
                    <p class="article">
                        The original design for the homepage was not very user friendly. Each of the letters in
                        the word "Innovate" were links that led to different parts of their website, but there was
                        no indication of where each link would take the user, so I decided to scrap the idea altogether.
                        There is also the issue where the words "Innovate", "Educate", and "Promote" were too large to even
                        fit on a screen without having to zoom out.
                        <br><br>
                        From asking the club members some general questions, it seemed that the visitors of this website
                        would be potential sponsors and people in the engineering industry who wanted to know more about the
                        club. I then designed the homepage to clearly show the club's name, tagline, and mission statement.
